        While we sit on a hunk of rock, hurling around in space at a speed of 67,000 miles per hour about our sun, the
        solar system is also travelling at a speed of 45,000 miles per hour towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_Herculis">Lambda Herculis</a> on a spiral path.
        As if that's not enough travel, the whole Milky Way Galaxy is whizzing through the universe at an astounding 1.3
        million miles per hour. As to where the universe is heading for, nobody knows. We don't even know whether the
        universe has a boundary, or what the boundary looks like. The only thing we can be certain of is that 4 billion
        years later, the Milky Way Galaxy is going to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda%E2%80%93Milky_Way_collision">collide spectacularly</a> with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy">Andromeda Galaxy</a> which is one of the
        largest galaxies in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group">Local Group</a>, containing 1 trillion (10<sup>12</sup>)  stars and the Milky Way contains about 300 billion (3Ã—10<sup>11</sup>).

        Despite all this crazy movement, when we look at the stars in a clear night sky, they all seem to remain at exactly
        the same spots. This fact itself should give you a sense of the mind-boggling immensity of the universe, and the
        endless space between celestial bodies.
