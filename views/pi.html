    If you have, then you must have seen the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113957/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Net</a>
    (1995), starring Sandra Bullock and Jeremy Northam. There's a clip at the beginning of that film which I enjoyed particularly.
    Programmer Angela Bennett, played by Bullock, just finished a job and turned down persistent invites to dinner from a male colleague.
    She slid over to her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compaq</a> (ring a bell?) desktop,
    ordered a large pizza with regular crust and anchovies toppings from Pizza.net (of all places).
    After making herself a drink, she walked over to the fireplace that was made of a large Sony
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trinitron</a> screen, and changed the theme from an aquarium to a warm,
    cozy, electronic burning firewood. All the while,

    was playing in the background. I just loved the atmosphere create by this little electronic utopia.

    Now when you watch, it has really aged well. The equipment is definitively last century and only had
    a fraction of the computing power of a modern cellphone. But they were just as beautiful and elegant in an almost
    steam punk way. They were giant beasts, as old as dinosaurs, generation analog, yet they were concrete beings.
    A solid tangible mass that you could hold in your hands and feel the weight of it. There's a certain comfort and
    beauty to that feeling. In many ways, this solidity is a connection to reality, probably one of the last things to
    stop us from getting lost completely in the cyber world.

    Inevitably as time went by, digital replaced analog, slim and light replaced bulky and heavy, virtual replaced reality. 
    One day, cyborg will replace people, artificial intelligence will replace human intelligence and advance on its own.
    The only everlasting truth is the endless cycle of evolution. However, where it will take us remains to be seen.
