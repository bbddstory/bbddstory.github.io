    This is a portal to my home NAS, which stores thousands of movies, TV series, documentaries and so forth.
    As a video collector, I use NAS for storage as do most people. The collection has gotten so large that
    it exceeded my memory bank, and became impossible to govern by hand. Of course, there're many existing
    options out there for managing files. But why not make something of my own?
</p>
<p>
    The first problem here is how to transfer the huge catalog on the hard disk into a database. My solution was
    to use Node.js to systematically read, filter and rename each and every file and folder, then output them
    to respective tables according to category.
</p>
<p>
    The next question is what kind of database to use. I thought about using a real-time database, like firebase
    from Google, for speed, easy access and low overhead. However, the biggest limitation of real-time databases
    is that they don't support full text search out of the box. You either need to do something unpractically slow
    and complicated yourself or employ a costly third party solution, which is not really doable for me. Yet,
    this feature is vital for file management. So I had no choice but to ditch firebase, and use MySQL instead.
</p>
<p>
    So the entire data flow is as follow. A Node.js process is constantly running on the NAS for monitoring
    file changes. Once a new file is added, it will be processed automatically, and uploaded to the online MySQL
    database. Another set of Node.js processes are running on the server, acting as back-end for accessing the
    data. The front-end part was made using React, and hosted on the same server with a differnt port. Everything
    is deployed on the same hosting service.

    If you want to have a look inside, you can log in using demo/demo without write privileges.

    P.S. The mobile version of this site will be made using Vue.js, its development will start soon.
