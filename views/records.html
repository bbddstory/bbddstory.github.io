<h1>Going Deep</h1>
<h3>Into a different world</h3>

<p>
    I'm a scuba diver first, a free diver later. But my love for the latter has surprised even myself.

    Every year, I fly across the ocean to spend my annual holiday either in the Philippines or Indonisia,
    part of which to meet up with my Japanese friend Yamada for a scuba diving trip, the rest spend on an
    intensive free diving training. As any sport, there're many disciplines in free diving. The little guy
    to the left of the screen that moves up and down with your mouse is wearing a monofin that's shaped
    like a fish's tail which gives you incredible prepulsion efficiently. You can literally swim like a
    fish if you know how to use it. One of the most common practice for monofin is called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_weight_apnea" target="_blank">constant weight apnea</a>
    or CWT for short. At the time of writing this, the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freediving#World_records" target="_blank">world record</a>
    for men was created by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isla_Esp%C3%ADritu_Santo" target="_blank">Alexey Molchanov</a>
    from Russia on 18th July 2018 with a depth of -130 meters in 3min 55sec. For women, it's
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isla_Esp%C3%ADritu_Santo" target="_blank">Alessia Zecchini</a>
    from Italy on 26th July 2018 with a depth of -107 meters in 3min 44sec. I actually had the pleasure of
    meeting with Alexey Molchanov on Panglao Island at Bohol, in the Philippines, while we were both on a
    training trip.

    So how deep can I go personally? Do you see that orange dot on the guide line? That's the best I can do
    for now, 35 meters. I know it seems so shallow in comparison. But the most important thing to know is that
    depth is not the goal, it's never the goal. Surpass yourself, condition your body and mind to adapt to the
    pressure and low oxygen environment. Exercise constantly, build up your constitution. Train yourself to go
    down EASILY rather than deeply, and at the same time have FUN! That should be the real objective, don't you
    think?
